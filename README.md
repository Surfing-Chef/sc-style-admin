__A simple WordPress plugin allowing users to edit the styles and layout of the admin pages__

### Installation ###
Download a zip file containing the source code and documentation from [GitHub](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/sc-style-admin) or clone the package to your machine using the git command line interface:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/sc-style-admin.git
```
Activate plugin to author styles within `sc-style-admin.css`. The file is located: `wp-content > plugins > sc-style-admin`
