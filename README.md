# SC Style Admin #
> Version: 1.0

__A simple WordPress plugin allowing users to edit the styles and layout of the admin pages__

### Installation ###
Download a zip file containing the source code and documentation from [GitHub](https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/sc-style-admin) or clone the package into your WordPress plugins' root folder using the git command line interface:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Surfing-Chef/sc-style-admin.git  
```  
### Activation ###
Activate plugin to author styles within *sc-style-admin.css*. The file is located in *wp-content > plugins > sc-style-admin*.  

__Important: Custom styles will be deleted if the plugin is uninstalled/deleted.__  The stylesheet and its content are only used by WordPress when the plugin is activated. Although still in the plugin folder, WordPress will ignore custom styles if the plugin is not activated. Be sure to back up the *sc-style-admin.css* file if changing themes or migrating WordPress, plugins or themes.
